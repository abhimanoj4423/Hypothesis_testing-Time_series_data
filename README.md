# Hypothesis_testing-Time_series_data

A data science project to understand the correlation between the 'Wind - Mean Speed (kn)' and the various factors affecting, namely **'Wind - Mean Direction','Pressure at Mean Sea Level (hPa)', 'Relative Humidity','Temperature - Dry Bulb (Â°C)', 'Wind - Max Gust Speed (kn)', 'Month'** and **'Relative Humidity'**. The dataset used in Edinburgh wind dataset containing the information abount wind speeds from1999 to 2008.

## Steps involved
## 1. EDA
## 2. Feature Engineering
#### 2.1 Feature Tranformation
#### 2.2 Feature reduction
#### 2.3 Feature construction
## 3. Correlation tests
* Asumption - Identical and Normal Distribution to find the dependency of windspeed with various metrices
#### 3.1 Spearman Rank Correlation
#### 3.2 Pearson correlation
## 4. Test of stationarity methods.
#### 4.1 Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
* Null Hypothesis (HO): Series is non-stationary, or series has a unit root.
* Alternate Hypothesis(HA): Series is stationary, or series has no unit root.
#### 4.2 Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test
* Null hypothesis (H0) - An observable time series is stationary around a deterministic trend.
